Experimental seed viewer / NBT editor / Data Pack IDE for Minecraft JE 1.14 (or something)

I'm going to be starting school soon so don't expect too much in the coming months :(

It is, however, something like 3-5x faster than AMIDST and shows twice the resolution, so it's got that going

I used the reverse engineered and optimized algorithms from [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes/) to generate most of the terrain, but I had to implement the structure finding methods myself and also wrote the NBT viewer from scratch. I know next to nothing about OpenGL so the texture loading is pretty unoptimized as well. If you're able to get this compiled, hats off
